A self-hosted internet radio station: one shared broadcast stream, **equal-power crossfades**, and **loudness level-matching** so quiet and loud tracks play back at a consistent volume. It never emits dead air. Deployed entirely via Docker.

No hand-built audio engine. A C# / .NET 10 control plane orchestrates [Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) (real-time mix, crossfade, encode) and [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) (fan-out). Selection is criteria-based — the feeder pulls through `INextItemProvider` over a media library catalog; there is no ordered playlist table.

This is **GenWave Home**, the AGPL edition — see [License](#license).

🎧 **Hear it live:** [demo.genwaveradio.com](https://demo.genwaveradio.com/) — the public demo station, running the [reference appliance topology](DEPLOYMENT.md): watch what's on the air and tune in!


## Quickstart

You need Docker (with Compose) and a music library of `.mp3`/`.flac` files.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, LIBRARY_DB_PASSWORD, STATION_DB_PASSWORD,
#            ICECAST_SOURCE_PASSWORD, ICECAST_ADMIN_PASSWORD,
#            MEDIA_DIR (absolute path to your library),
#            and ADMIN_PASSWORD (admin UI login; leave blank for open API in local dev)

./build.sh
./launch.sh
```

Seven services start: `db`, `icecast`, `engine`, `api`, `kokoro` (TTS synthesizer), `piper` (CPU-only fallback TTS), and `admin_ui` (operator console). An optional eighth — a Cloudflare tunnel with health/metrics observability — is available behind `COMPOSE_PROFILES=tunnel` (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)).

- **Stream:** `http://localhost:8000/stream` — open it in any audio player
- **Admin UI:** `http://localhost:3000` — log in with the password set in `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- **API:** `http://localhost:8080` — anonymous hot path (`GET /media/random`, `GET /media/{id}`, `GET /health`) plus the cookie-auth admin surface under `/api/*`

On first boot the library scans `MEDIA_DIR`, enriches each file (loudness + cue + energy + BPM + tags, plus a high-confidence MusicBrainz release-year lookup when the tags carry none — disable-able live via `Library:YearLookup:Enabled`), and the feeder begins pulling ready tracks. Until the first tracks are ready, the engine plays the safe-rotation source — a curated library scope (`Station:SafeScope:LibraryIds`) pulled via `GET /internal/safe-track`. On a fresh deploy, a one-shot boot seed creates a `safe` library, renders a branded TTS announcement ("Please Stand By"), and points SafeScope at it — so drains air the announcement, not a random track; an operator-set SafeScope is never overwritten. If the scope resolves empty, `mksafe` emits silence as a logged degraded mode. The Orchestrator interleaves TTS patter (station IDs, lead-ins, back-announces, time checks) with music once Kokoro is up. When an `Llm:Endpoint` is configured (Settings page — live, no restart), lead-ins and back-announces become LLM-authored copy, optionally in an operator-authored DJ persona's voice (Personas page); with no LLM configured the template patter airs unchanged. Station identity (`STATION_NAME`, voice, scope) defaults to `GWAV 108.8` / `af_heart` / library 1 — override via env if needed.

### Resilience & operator tools

The broadcast never depends on a sick dependency. **LLM failure is a mode, not an error**: consecutive failures walk the station Normal → Soft (one real LLM attempt per cooldown window, template copy otherwise) → Hard (zero LLM calls); background health probes plus a cooldown walk it back up, and an operator can pin any mode live (`Llm:DegradationPin`). **TTS failure is inaudible**: if Kokoro is down or a render throws, the segment re-renders on the Piper fallback engine through the same loudness pipeline — kill the Kokoro container mid-broadcast and the next patter still airs. Every spoken line passes one normalization chokepoint (reasoning-block scrub, markdown strip, operator **pronunciation corrections** — editable with live preview under Settings → TTS, e.g. `MacLeod → Muh-cloud`). The **Booth log** page answers "what did the DJ do and say at 9:14" as a persistent narrative feed (track starts, patter, mode changes, 14-day retention), with an **LLM call inspector** tab showing the last ~50 calls (prompt, response, timing, mode — in-memory, never persisted). MusicBrainz lookups are throttled to 1 req/s with a version-stamped User-Agent, and misses are stamped so they're never re-asked.

## Tests

```bash
# Core, Orchestration, Tts unit tests (no Docker needed):
dotnet test GenWave.sln --filter "Category!=Integration"

# Full suite including library + Kokoro integration tests (need Docker + ffmpeg):
dotnet test GenWave.sln

# §0 on-air acceptance gate (live engine required):
./tools/onair_gate.sh

# Admin UI (from admin-ui/): type-check, unit tests, production build — what CI runs:
npx tsc --noEmit && npm test && npm run build
```

Five test projects: `Core.Tests`, `Host.Tests`, `MediaLibrary.Tests`, `Orchestration.Tests`, `Tts.Tests`. The full suite plus the on-air gate are required before anything merges to `main`.

### Versions

GenWave releases follow a semantic versioning as follows:

```
<major_version>.<minor_version>.<bugfix_version>
```

Where:

- `major_version` is bumped when there are major changes, i.e. major implementation change etc. Versions with different major versions **are** incompatible
- `minor_version` is bumped when there are minor changes, i.e. new features, renaming, new modules etc. Versions with different minor versions **may be** incompatible
- `bugfix_version` is bumped when a new bugfix version is published. Versions with only bugfix version changes **should be** compatible


## Optional — prove the audio spine with the smoke test

Validates the riskiest third-party behavior (annotation format, Icecast password, crossfade overlap) with none of your own configuration in the way. Needs `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`, `jq`, and the .NET 10 SDK on the host.

```bash
# Load MEDIA_DIR from .env into the shell (paths must resolve under the engine's /media mount)
set -a; . ./.env; set +a

# 1. Pick the most divergent (quiet vs. loud) track pair from your library
cd tools
dotnet run find_smoke_candidates.cs -- "$MEDIA_DIR"
cd ..

# 2. Run the automated smoke test. Brings up db+engine+icecast, pushes the pair, records the
#    stream, asserts output LUFS ≈ target for both with no silent gap at the crossfade.
#    Exits non-zero on failure. (SMOKE_DOWN=1 to tear down after.)
cp tools/smoke-candidates.json .
./tools/smoke_test.sh
```

> ⚠️ The smoke test is a **manual pre-release gate** — CI does not run it. It uses the default
> compose project and pushes test tracks onto whatever engine it targets: run it only against a
> scratch stack (fresh checkout or isolated `-p` project), never a live station's deployment.

If level checks fail by a consistent offset, the `replay_gain` annotation format is wrong (bare number vs `"X.XX dB"`) — the test's failure message points at this.

## Shipped phases

GenWave's epic-by-epic history — v1 broadcast playout through Ranking & robustness — lives in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Roadmap

- **Observability expansion (designed, unbuilt)** — fleet log shipping (Grafana Alloy → Loki/Grafana) over Cloudflare-Access-gated tunnels, plus `launch.sh` presets (`--pinned`, `--with`). Spec: [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) F78.
- **Deferred** — authored-file GC (gitea-#205), legacy contract cleanup (gitea-#206).
- **Beat-matching + set-level sequencing** — BPM/beat-aware transitions and energy-curve scheduling beyond per-pair crossfade duration. Deferred as YAGNI.

## Operational notes

- The Liquidsoap **control port (1234) is unauthenticated and never published**. To inspect it: `docker compose exec engine bash` then connect to `localhost:1234` from inside the container.
- Icecast `/admin` and `/status` share port 8000 — password-protected but reachable on the LAN. **Never publish 8000 on a public box**: the [reference public topology](DEPLOYMENT.md) fronts everything with Caddy and un-publishes it, and CI enforces the posture via `tools/check-compose-publish.sh` (0.0.0.0 publishes allowed only for the proxy).
- **Upgrading an existing deployment:** run `./migrate.sh` after pulling a new release — it applies every `db/*-migration.sh` idempotently against the running stack (`./migrate.sh -f compose.yaml -f compose.demo.yaml` on a demo/appliance box; see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)). `./launch.sh` does this automatically for the dev stack; a raw `docker compose up` does **not**.
- Secrets live only in `.env` (gitignored). Promote to Docker secrets before anything public.
- If you change `duration=` in `engine/genwave.liq`, pass the matching `CROSSFADE=` to `smoke_test.sh` so its analysis windows line up.
- The `crossfade` operator behavior and `output.icecast.metadata` on-air signal are specific to Liquidsoap 2.4.x. The engine image is pinned to `v2.4.4` in `compose.yaml` — do not change the pin without re-running the smoke test.

## Built with AI assistance

GenWave is developed openly with AI as a force multiplier for the people (me) building it — not a replacement for them.
